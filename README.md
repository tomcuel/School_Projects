# üéì School Projects
> This repository contains different projects I have worked on during my studies.  
> They cover a variety of topics such as programming, algorithms, data analysis, optimization, and systems.  
> Each project is in its own sub-repository/folder, with its own `README` explaining the context, goals, results, and how to run it.  
> 
> These projects are a mix of coursework, assignments, and personal explorations related to class topics.

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Chess Engine 
Repository: [Chess_Game_C_IN104](./Chess_Game_C_IN104)  
Language: **C**  
**Notes:** This project was developed for a computer science course.
The task was to create a chess game in C using the SDL library.
The project includes a basic game implementation, introduction of a simple AI, and continued improvements beyond the original course version (up to V7).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Differentiable Optimisation
Repository: [Differentiable_Optimisation_Projects](./Differentiable_Optimisation_Projects)  
Language: **Python**  
**Notes:** This repository contains two projects exploring both theoretical understanding and practical applications of differentiable optimization methods.
One implements Newton‚Äôs method for solving equilibrium problems, and the other uses proximal gradient methods for image deblurring.

## üßÆ Finite Element Simulation
Repository: [Elements_Finis_Simulation](./Elements_Finis_Simulation)  
Language: **MATLAB**   
**Notes:** The first lab focuses on a basic implementation of the Finite Element Method for solving a Poisson equation.
The second lab goes further by simulating the flow of an incompressible, viscous, steady fluid in a 2D channel using the Stokes equations, with multiple parameters, boundary conditions, and even an inlet step at the end of the channel.

## üî• Firing a thermoformed part
Repository: [Matlab-Project](./Matlab-Project)  
Language: **MATLAB**   
**Notes:** Compute the temperature map in an oven for firing a thermoformed part.
Covers direct (effect of heater placement), inverse (heater settings for target temperature), and optimization problems (best configuration) using the Finite Element Method.

## ‚öôÔ∏è SQP Algorithm 
Repository: [Optimization_SQP_Python](./Optimization_SQP_Python)  
Language: **Python**  
**Notes:** Implementation of the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm to minimize an objective function under constraints.

---

## üöÄ PIE_Trajectory_Optimisation
Repository: [PIE_Trajectory_Optimisation](./PIE_Trajectory_Optimisation)  
Language: **C++**  
**Notes:** Trajectory planning in a complex environment with obstacles using Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm.
Used for predicting shortest paths for autonomous vehicles and as practice in modeling and C++ programming.

---

## üöó PIE Vehicule Dynamic
Repository: [PIE_Vehicule_Dynamic](./PIE_Vehicule_Dynamic)  
Language: **Python**  
**Notes:** Optimization of vehicle speed and power output to complete laps within a target time for the Shell Eco Marathon.
Parameters can be adapted for different vehicles, with autonomous driving control not done there.

## üèòÔ∏è Real Estate Market Analysis
Repository: [Real_Estate_Market_Analysis_Project](./Real_Estate_Market_Analysis_Project)  
Language: **R**  
**Notes:** Analysis of the real estate market in Ille-et-Vilaine, France.
Uses historical data to identify factors affecting house prices and build simple predictive models.

---

## üìä Statistic Learning
Repository: [Statistic_Learning_Project](./Statistic_Learning_Project)  
Language: **R**  
**Notes:** Classification of raisins into two varieties (Kecimen and Besni) using physical characteristics for final project applying statistical learning methods from the course.

## üî¨ TIPE
Repository: [TIPE](./TIPE)  
Language: **Python**  
**Notes:** Preparatory classes project for nationwide exams.
Study of GPS measurement principles and errors using sport watches and bike computers.
Includes static and dynamic experiments, data analysis, visualization, and modeling tools combining math, physics, and programming.
